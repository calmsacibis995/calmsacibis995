### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm fascinated with Unix and Unix-like operating systems. I started having a interest in technology at the age of 8, programming at 14, and, here we are today. Huge advocate of the open-source community, using a computer running a Windows 10/Linux dualboot setup, and love tinkering with old and new tech.

In my profile, you can find repositories filled with source code from various Unix operating systems, ancient, modern, commercial, such as Solaris, HP-UX, IRIX, etc., among other things.
